My profile for windows powershell

For the autohotkey to work:

* download 'VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll' from [github](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor/releases/) and place in this folder
* Install AutoHotKey: `winget install "AutoHotKey v2"`
* Starting the script with AutoHotKey 2 places an hotkey icon in the traybar.
* You can now change a window to another desktop with shift+windows+number
* You can move to the desktop with windows+number
* If you create a short cut of the script and place it in C:\Users\Eelco\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup, the script will be automatically started.
